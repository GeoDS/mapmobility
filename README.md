## Abstract
To contain the COVID-19 epidemic, one of the non-pharmacological epidemic control measures is reducing the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2 in the population through social distancing. An interactive web-based mapping platform that provides timely quantitative information on how people in different counties and states reacted to the social distancing guidelines was developed by the GeoDS Lab @UW-Madison with the support of the National Science Foundation RAPID program. The web dashboard portal integrates geographic information systems (GIS) and daily updated human mobility statistical patterns (median travel distance and stay-at-home dwell time) derived from large-scale anonymized and aggregated smartphone location big data at the county-level in the United States, and aims to increase risk awareness of the public, support data-driven public health and governmental decision-making, and help enhance community responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
